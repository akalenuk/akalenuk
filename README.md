I'm Oleksandr Kaleniuk, a Ukrainian software engineer.

I do [Words and Buttons](https://wordsandbuttons.online).

I also wrote [Geometry for Programmers](https://www.manning.com/books/geometry-for-programmers) book (also [available from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Geometry-Programmers-Oleksandr-Kaleniuk/dp/1633439607)).

Currently, just like 42 million other Ukrainians, I am at war with Russia. If you want to contact me, and you don't know me already, now is probably not a good time.
