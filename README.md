I'm Oleksandr Kaleniuk, a Ukrainian software engineer.

I do [Words and Buttons](https://wordsandbuttons.online).

I also wrote [Geometry for Programmers](https://www.manning.com/books/geometry-for-programmers) book.

Currently, just like 42 million other Ukrainians, I am at war with Russia. If you want to contact me, and you don't know me already, now is probably not a good time.
